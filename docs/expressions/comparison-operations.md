# Expressions: Comparison Operations

## Equal To

Equal to can be used to compare two expressions using the `==` operator, followed by the expression to compare to the right.

```
$foo = $bar == $baz;
```

## Not Equal To

Not equal to can be used to compare two expressions using the `!=` operator, followed by the expression to compare to the right.

```
$foo = $bar != $baz;
```

## Identical To

Identical to can be used to compare two expressions using the `===` operator, followed by the expression to compare to the right.

```
$foo = $bar === $baz;
```

## Not Identical To

Not identical to can be used to compare two expressions using the `!==` operator, followed by the expression to compare to the right.

```
$foo = $bar !== $baz;
```

## Greater Than

Greater than can be used to compare two expressions using the `>` operator, followed by the expression to compare to the right.

```
$foo = $bar > $baz;
```

## Greater Than Or Equal To

Greater than or equal to can be used to compare two expressions using the `>=` operator, followed by the expression to compare to the right.

```
$foo = $bar >= $baz;
```

## Less Than

Less than can be used to compare two expressions using the `<` operator, followed by the expression to compare to the right.

```
$foo = $bar < $baz;
```

## Less Than Or Equal To

Less than or equal to can be used to compare two expressions using the `<=` operator, followed by the expression to compare to the right.

```
$foo = $bar <= $baz;
```

## Spaceship

```
$foo = $bar <=> $baz;
```
