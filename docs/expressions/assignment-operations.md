# Expressions: Assignment Operations

## Assignment Operator

Assignment can be used to assign a value to a variable using the `=` operator, followed by the expression to assign to the left.

```
$foo = $bar;
```

## Addition Assignment Operator

Addition assignment can be used to add a value to a variable using the `+=` operator, followed by the expression to add to the left.

```
$foo += $bar;
```

## Subtraction Assignment Operator

Subtraction assignment can be used to subtract a value from a variable using the `-=` operator, followed by the expression to subtract from the left.

```
$foo -= $bar;
```

## Multiplication Assignment Operator

Multiplication assignment can be used to multiply a value to a variable using the `*=` operator, followed by the expression to multiply to the left.

```
$foo *= $bar;
```

## Division Assignment Operator

Division assignment can be used to divide a value from a variable using the `/=` operator, followed by the expression to divide from the left.

```
$foo /= $bar;
```

## Modulus Assignment Operator

Modulus assignment can be used to get the modulus of a value from a variable using the `%=` operator, followed by the expression to get the modulus from the left.

```
$foo %= $bar;
```

## Exponentiation Assignment Operator

Exponentiation assignment can be used to exponentiate a value to a variable using the `**=` operator, followed by the expression to exponentiate to the left.

```
$foo **= $bar;
```

## Concatenation Assignment Operator

Concatenation assignment can be used to concatenate a value to a variable using the `.=` operator, followed by the expression to concatenate to the left.

```
$foo .= $bar;
```

## Bitwise And Assignment Operator

Bitwise and assignment can be used to bitwise and a value to a variable using the `&=` operator, followed by the expression to bitwise and to the left.

```
$foo &= $bar;
```

## Bitwise Or Assignment Operator

Bitwise or assignment can be used to bitwise or a value to a variable using the `|=` operator, followed by the expression to bitwise or to the left.

```
$foo |= $bar;
```

## Bitwise Xor Assignment Operator

Bitwise xor assignment can be used to bitwise xor a value to a variable using the `^=` operator, followed by the expression to bitwise xor to the left.

```
$foo ^= $bar;
```

## Bitwise Shift Left Assignment Operator

Bitwise shift left assignment can be used to bitwise shift left a value to a variable using the `<<=` operator, followed by the expression to bitwise shift left to the left.

```
$foo <<= $bar;
```

## Bitwise Shift Right Assignment Operator

Bitwise shift right assignment can be used to bitwise shift right a value to a variable using the `>>=` operator, followed by the expression to bitwise shift right to the left.

```
$foo >>= $bar;
```

## Null Coalescing Assignment Operator

Null coalescing assignment can be used to assign a value to a variable if it is null using the `??=` operator, followed by the expression to assign to the left.

```
$foo ??= $bar;
```
