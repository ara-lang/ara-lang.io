# Expression: Bitwise Operations

## Bitwise And

Bitwise and can be used to evaluate two expressions using the `&` operator, followed by the expression to evaluate to the right.

```
$foo = $bar & $baz;
```

## Bitwise Or

Bitwise or can be used to evaluate two expressions using the `|` operator, followed by the expression to evaluate to the right.

```
$foo = $bar | $baz;
```

## Bitwise Xor

Bitwise xor can be used to evaluate two expressions using the `^` operator, followed by the expression to evaluate to the right.

```
$foo = $bar ^ $baz;
```

## Bitwise Not

Bitwise not can be used to evaluate an expression using the `~` operator.

```
$foo = ~$bar;
```

## Bitwise Shift Left

Bitwise shift left can be used to evaluate two expressions using the `<<` operator, followed by the expression to evaluate to the right.

```
$foo = $bar << $baz;
```

## Bitwise Shift Right

Bitwise shift right can be used to evaluate two expressions using the `>>` operator, followed by the expression to evaluate to the right.

```
$foo = $bar >> $baz;
```
