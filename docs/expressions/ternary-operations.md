# Expressions: Ternary Operations

## Ternary Operator

The ternary operator can be used to conditionally evaluate an expression using the `?` operator, followed by the expression to evaluate if the condition is true, followed by the `:` operator, followed by the expression to evaluate if the condition is false.

```
$foo = $bar ? $bar : $baz;
```

## Short Ternary Operator

The short ternary operator can be used to conditionally evaluate an expression using the `?:` operator, followed by the expression to evaluate if the condition is false.

```
$foo = $bar ?: $baz;
```
